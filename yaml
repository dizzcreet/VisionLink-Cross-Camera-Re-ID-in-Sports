# Player Re-Identification – Report

## 🎯 Objective
To assign consistent player IDs across two different camera feeds: a broadcast and a tactical view.

---

## 🛠️ Approach

1. **Detection**: Used the provided YOLOv11 model to detect players in both videos.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extracted the center coordinates of each player's bounding box as spatial features.
3. **Matching**: Matched players across camera feeds using Euclidean distance between bounding box centers.
4. **ID Assignment**: Assigned consistent IDs across both feeds based on matches.

## 🧪 Techniques Tried

- Spatial matching using center coordinates of bounding boxes
- Frame-by-frame matching
- Option to save and visualize matched results

---

## ❗ Challenges Faced

- Limited feature diversity — purely spatial matching can be unreliable for overlapping or similar positions
- Lack of temporal consistency — IDs aren't persistent over time without tracking
- No deep features or uniform color processing yet

---

## 🚧 Incomplete? What’s Next?

- Add **tracking algorithms** (e.g. Deep SORT or ByteTrack) to maintain consistent IDs over time
- Use **color histograms** or **CNN embeddings** to improve player re-identification
- Optimize performance for real-time processing
- Extend to detect and re-ID the **ball**

---

## ✅ Outcome

- Basic player detection and ID consistency between camera feeds achieved
- Functional and modular pipeline built with extensibility in mind
